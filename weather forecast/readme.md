This is a Dynamic web page bulit using HTML, CSS and javascript to get Weather forecast for the current day using WeatherApi.
Enter the Location in the search box to get the weaher report.
To get the data from the API, I used XMLHttpRequest object and the data is returned in JSON(Javascript Object Notation) format.
